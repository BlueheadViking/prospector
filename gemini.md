**Project Overview – Leatherworks Studio**

**Name:** Prospector Leatherworks *(Heritage feel, rooted in craftsmanship and exploration)*

**Vision:**
To make tough, functional, and beautiful leather gear built to last. Every belt, strap, or wallet should carry marks of the journey, wear in with time, and outlive cheap throwaway gear. Prospector Leatherworks is about raw honesty – pulling from the West Coast bush, the Otago schist, and the grit of the goldrush era.

**Mission:**
Keep it simple: strong leather, solid brass, clean stitching. Make gear that can handle rain, dust, salt, and hard use. Inspired by South Island landscapes – from alpine passes to black‑sand beaches – every piece is meant to be used, not shelved. Write and explain things in a straight‑up, clear way, so anyone (even without technical know‑how) can understand what it’s about.

**Core Values:**

* **Craftsmanship** – built by hand, meant to age well.
* **Authenticity** – no shortcuts, no fake finishes.
* **Utility** – made to work, not just look good.
* **Connection** – rooted in New Zealand land and stories.
* **Durability** – survives rough use in the field.
* **Longevity** – gear that wears in, not out.
* **Adventure** – kit for explorers, hunters, fishermen, and wanderers.
* **Clarity** – no jargon; explained in plain language.

**Primary Products:**

* Belts (full‑grain, vegetable‑tanned cowhide, custom stamped).
* Camera straps and bag straps.
* Small goods (key fobs, wallets, field gear).
* Protective leather balm (NZ beeswax‑based, whisky/goldrush inspired).

**Design Language & Themes:**

* Earthy tones: greens, tans, greys, brass, and weathered leather.
* Goldrush grit – picks, topo lines, claim markers.
* Regional cues – West Coast rainforests, Otago rock and dust, alpine rivers.
* Textures – canvas, topo emboss, stitched seams, worn paper.
* Imagery – huts, maps, sluice boxes, river fords, weathered trails.

**Materials & Hardware:**

* Full‑grain, vegetable‑tanned cowhide.
* Brass or copper hardware that won’t quit.
* Beeswax and natural oils for care.
* Packaging: kraft card, waxed canvas wrap, stamped mark.

**Stamps & Markings:**

* Topo line emboss (river bend, ridge, saddle).
* Claim‑style serials (e.g., **PL‑OTAGO‑0027**).
* Simple prospecting icons – pick, pan, stake.

**Target Audience:**

* Outdoorsmen, explorers, fishermen, hunters.
* People who want gear that lasts, not fast fashion.
* Local NZ buyers and international niche markets drawn to heritage and honesty.

**Distribution Strategy:**

* Direct online sales (prospector.nz, kept clean and no fuss).
* Local craft fairs and markets.
* Small‑batch runs with a story, never mass production.

**Growth Opportunities:**

* Collaborations with outdoor/photography brands.
* Bags and larger gear down the track.
* Export niche – heritage NZ‑made, built tough.
